Feature: Match Unmatch Diff Curves Dieoff

    As an unauthenticated user to the app,
    with the app in its default state so that the plots are Dieoff,
    I want to add two curves, plot unmatched, and then return to the main page.
    I then want to add a matched difference curve, plot unmatched, return to the main page, plot matched, and then return to the main page.
    I then want to add a piecewise difference curve, plot unmatched, return to the main page, plot matched, and then return to the main page.
    I want to end by removing all of the curves.

    Background:
        Given I load the app "/met-anomalycor"
        Then I expect the app title to be "MET Anomaly Correlation"

    Scenario: matchUnmatchDiffCurvesDieoff
        When I set the plot type to "Dieoff"
        Then the plot type should be "Dieoff"
        When I change the "group" parameter to "vhagerty"
        Then the "group" parameter value matches "vhagerty"
        When I change the "database" parameter to "mv_gsd"
        Then the "database" parameter value matches "mv_gsd"
        When I change the "data-source" parameter to "GFS"
        Then the "data-source" parameter value matches "GFS"
        When I change the "level" parameter to "P500"
        Then the "level" parameter value matches "P500"
        When I set the curve-dates to "11/01/2018 00:00 - 11/11/2018 00:00"
        Then the curve-dates value is "11/01/2018 00:00 - 11/11/2018 00:00"
        When I change the "dieoff-type" parameter to "Dieoff for a specified UTC cycle init hour"
        Then the "dieoff-type" parameter value matches "Dieoff for a specified UTC cycle init hour"

        And the "Plot Matched" button should be visible

        When I change the "plotFormat" parameter to "Diff all curves against the 1st added curve"
        Then "Curve1-Curve0" is added
        And I should see a list of curves containing "Curve0,Curve1,Curve1-Curve0"

        When I click the "Plot Unmatched" button
        Then I should be on the graph page

        When I click the "Back" button
        Then I should be on the main page
        And the "Plot Matched" button should be visible

        When I change the "plotFormat" parameter to "Diff the 1st and 2nd curves, 3rd and 4th, etc"
        Then I should see a list of curves containing "Curve0,Curve1,Curve1-Curve0"
        And I should have 3 curves

        When I click the "Plot Unmatched" button
