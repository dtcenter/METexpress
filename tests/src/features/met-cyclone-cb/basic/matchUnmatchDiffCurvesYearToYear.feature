Feature: Match Unmatch Diff Curves Year To Year

    As an unauthenticated user to the app,
    with the app in its default state so that the plots are YearToYear,
    I want to add two curves, plot unmatched, and then return to the main page.
    I then want to add a matched difference curve, plot unmatched, return to the main page, plot matched, and then return to the main page.
    I then want to add a piecewise difference curve, plot unmatched, return to the main page, plot matched, and then return to the main page.
    I want to end by removing all of the curves.

    Background:
        Given I load the app "/met-cyclone-cb"
        Then I expect the app title to be "MET Cyclone"

    Scenario: matchUnmatchDiffCurvesYearToYear
        When I set the plot type to "YearToYear"
        Then the plot type should be "YearToYear"
        When I change the "database" parameter to "gopa01"
        Then the "database" parameter value matches "gopa01"
        When I change the "data-source" parameter to "GFSO: GFS"
        Then the "data-source" parameter value matches "GFSO: GFS"
        When I change the "basin" parameter to "AL"
        Then the "basin" parameter value matches "AL"
        When I change the "statistic" parameter to "Track error (nm)"
        Then the "statistic" parameter value matches "Track error (nm)"
        When I set the dates to "01/01/2023 00:00 - 12/31/2024 23:59"
        Then the dates value is "01/01/2023 00:00 - 12/31/2024 23:59"

        When I change the "plotFormat" parameter to "Diff the 1st and 2nd curves, 3rd and 4th, etc"
        Then I should see a list of curves containing "Curve0,Curve1,Curve1-Curve0"
        And I should have 3 curves
