History
-------
The Model Evaluation Tools (MET) were developed by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)  and released in January 2008.  The goal of the tools was to provide the community with a platform independent and extensible framework for reproducible verification.  The DTC partners, including NCAR, NOAA, and the USAF, decided to start by replicating the NOAA EMC (see list of acronyms below) Mesoscale Branch verification package, called VSDB.  In the first release, MET included several pre-processing, statistical, and analysis tools to provided the primary functionality as the EMC VSDB system, and also included a spatial verification package called MODE.

Over the years, MET and VSDB packages grew in complexity.  Verification capability at other NOAA laboratories, such as ESRL, were also under heavy development.  An effort to unify verification capability was first started under the HIWPP project and led by NOAA ESRL.  In 2015, the NGGPS Program Office started working groups to focus on several aspects of the next gen system, including the Verification and Validation Working Group.  This group made the recommendation to use MET as the foundation for a unified verification capability.  In 2016, NCAR and GSD leads visited EMC to gather requirements.  At that time, the concept of METplus was developed as it extends beyond the original code base.  It was originally called METplus but several constraints have driven the transition to the use of METplus. METplus is now the unified verification, validation, and diagnostics capability for NOAA's UFS and a component of NCAR's SIMA modeling frameworks.  It being actively developed by NCAR, ESRL, EMC and is open to community contributions.
