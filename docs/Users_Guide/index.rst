**Foreword: A note to MET users**

This User's Guide is provided as an aid to users of the Model Evaluation
Tools Express (METexpress). METexpress is an easy-to-use interface that
displays plots of statistical verification metrics for data that a user
defines interactively.  It was developed by NOAA/Global Systems Laboratory
the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) as part of the METplus suite of
verification tools. It is also the core component of the unified METplus
verification framework. More details about METplus can be found on the
`METplus website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_.

It is important to note here that METexpress is an evolving software package.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
METexpress may be able to accept contributions from the community.
If you have code you would like to contribute, we will gladly consider your
contribution.  Please send an email to: `mats.gsl@noaa.gov <mailto:>`__.
We will then determine if we will be able to include the contribution in a
future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of METexpress, including
Bonny Strong, Randy Pierce, Molly B. Smith, Venita Hagerty, and Jeff Hamilton.
